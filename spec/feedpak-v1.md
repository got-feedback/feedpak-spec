# feedpak Format Specification

- **Specification version:** 1.12.0
- **Format major version:** 1
- **Status:** Draft
- **Date:** 2026-07-01
- **Editors:** The feedpak authors
- **License:** [CC0 1.0 Universal](../LICENSE) (this document)
- **Machine-readable schemas:** [`schemas/`](../schemas/) (MIT)

## Abstract

**feedpak** is an open, hand-editable package format for interactive music notation —
guitar/bass tab, standard notation, drum tabs, lyrics, vocal pitch, beats, sections, and the
audio stems that go with them. A feedpak holds the authored data for a single song. The format
is plain-text-first (YAML index + JSON data), self-describing, and designed to be extended
without breaking existing readers.

This document is the **authoritative reference** for the on-disk format. It is independent of
any single implementation: anyone may read, write, implement, or extend feedpak under the terms
above, with no obligation to any project.

---

## 1. Conformance

### 1.1. Requirement keywords

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**,
**SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and
[RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

### 1.2. Roles

- A **Reader** is any program that opens a feedpak and consumes its data.
- A **Writer** is any program that produces a feedpak.
- A **conformant feedpak** is a package that satisfies every MUST in this document.

A conformant Reader **MUST NOT** reject a feedpak solely because it carries keys, files, or
fields the Reader does not recognise (see [§4, Versioning](#4-versioning) and
[§9, Extending the format](#9-extending-the-format)). Forward-compatibility through ignored-but-
preserved unknown data is a load-bearing property of this format.

### 1.3. What this document does and does not govern

This specification governs the **bytes of the package on disk** — its structure, its files, and
the schemas of those files. It does **not** govern any runtime transport, API, or rendering
behaviour an application layers on top. Where such implementation detail is informative, it is
confined to a clearly-labelled **non-normative** appendix (see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-non-normative--streaming-and-runtime-notes)).

---

## 2. Format at a glance

A feedpak exists in **two interchangeable forms** that hold identical contents:

| Form | What it is | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| **Directory** | A folder named `*.feedpak/` containing the files below | Authoring, hand editing, tooling development |
| **Zip archive** | A `.feedpak` file (a ZIP archive with the same files inside) | Distribution |

A Reader **MUST** accept both forms and **SHOULD** treat them as equivalent. A Reader that
unpacks the zip form to a cache **SHOULD** key that cache on the archive's size and
modification time so a re-packed archive is re-read.

### 2.1. Directory layout

```
my-song.feedpak/

└── cover.jpg                 # OPTIONAL — album art
```

### 2.2. Three core rules

1. **`manifest.yaml` is the index.** Nothing inside a feedpak is auto-discovered by scanning —
   every consumed file is referenced from the manifest. Readers **MUST NOT** rely on filename
   conventions to locate data; they **MUST** resolve files through the manifest. (Writers MAY
   use the conventional filenames shown here, but Readers MUST follow the manifest's pointers.)
2. **Paths in `manifest.yaml` are POSIX-style relative paths** from the feedpak root: forward
   slashes, no leading `/`, no `..` segments, no empty segments (`//`), no colon (`:`) — which
   excludes drive letters and alternate-data-stream paths — and no backslashes. Readers **MUST**
   reject paths that escape the package root.
3. **YAML for the manifest, JSON (or JSONC) for data files.** The manifest is YAML so it is
   comfortable to hand-edit; all structured data files are JSON (or JSONC, where the `.jsonc`
   extension signals that the file MAY contain `//` line comments and `/* */` block comments).
   A YAML manifest is, by [YAML 1.2](https://spec.yaml.io/main/spec/1.2.2/) rules, valid against the
   JSON-Schema definitions in [`schemas/`](../schemas/) (YAML is a JSON superset for this
   purpose).

---

## 3. Encodings and conventions

- **Text files** (`manifest.yaml`, all `*.json`, all `*.jsonc`) **MUST** be UTF-8 encoded. A
  Writer **SHOULD NOT** emit a byte-order mark.
- **Time** is always expressed in **seconds as a JSON number** (floating point), measured from
  the start of the song's audio. Time fields are named `t` or `time`. Writers **MUST NOT** use
  milliseconds, ticks, or sample counts.
- **Field names** in hot-path data (notes, chords, hits, beats) are deliberately short because
  they may be repeated tens of thousands of times in one file. Writers **MUST NOT** expand
  them. One-off metadata MAY use long, descriptive names.
- **Audio stems** default to OGG (Vorbis) at a quality around `-q:a 5` (size/fidelity balance).
  OGG and WAV together form the **baseline every Reader MUST decode**; other formats MAY be
  carried and are dispatched by file extension (or an explicit `codec` override); see
  [§5.3.2](#532-audio-formats--baseline-dispatch-and-portability) for the full decoder baseline,
  codec-resolution precedence, and portability rule. **Cover art** is JPEG or PNG, conventionally
  square, 500–1500 px on a side.
- **Unknown keys / files / fields** are reserved for forward-compatibility. Readers **MUST**
  ignore them rather than error, and Writers that copy or re-emit a feedpak **SHOULD** preserve
  them verbatim.

---

## 4. Versioning

feedpak distinguishes **three independent version axes**. Conflating them is the most common
mistake when implementing the format, so they are defined separately here.

### 4.1. Format version — `feedpak_version`

The manifest **SHOULD** carry a top-level `feedpak_version` key whose value is a
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) string (for example `"1.0.0"`). It declares
which version of *this format* the package conforms to.

```yaml
feedpak_version: "1.12.0"
```

- A Writer producing a feedpak that conforms to this document **SHOULD** set
  `feedpak_version: "1.12.0"`. (The optional fields added since 1.0.0 —
  [`authors`](#54-authors) in 1.1.0; the song-level [`tempos`](#74-song_timelinejson) /
  [`time_signatures`](#74-song_timelinejson) plus the per-arrangement
  [`tempos`](#610-per-arrangement-tempo-optional) override in 1.2.0; the per-note bend shape
  [`bt`](#621-bend-shape-bt-bnv) / [`bnv`](#621-bend-shape-bt-bnv) in 1.4.0; the per-note
  teaching marks [`fg`](#622-teaching-marks-fg-ch-sd) / [`ch`](#622-teaching-marks-fg-ch-sd) /
  [`sd`](#622-teaching-marks-fg-ch-sd) in 1.5.0; and the per-chord harmony annotations
  [`fn`](#631-harmonic-function-fn) / [`voicing`](#66-chord-templates) in 1.7.0; and the
  template harmony descriptors [`caged`](#66-chord-templates) / [`guideTones`](#66-chord-templates)
  in 1.8.0 — are all additive, so an older Reader simply ignores what it does not recognise.
  1.3.0 added no on-disk field. 1.6.0 adds no new manifest
  key or note/side-file field either, but it does newly permit the `.jsonc` data-file extension
  (see [§8](#8-reading-and-writing)): such files MAY contain comments that a Reader **MUST** strip,
  so — unlike the additive fields above — a comment-bearing `.jsonc` file requires a JSONC-aware
  Reader rather than being silently ignorable. 1.9.0 adds the optional stem
  [`codec`](#53-stems) hint and broadens audio beyond OGG behind a MUST-decode baseline; a pack
  that stays within the baseline is unaffected, while one that carries a non-baseline stem
  format requires a Reader that supports it — the same opt-in shape as `.jsonc`, per the
  [§4.2 carve-out](#42-compatibility-policy). 1.10.0 adds the optional song-level
  [`harmony`](#78-harmonyjson) side-file (intended chord progression) — additive, an older Reader
  simply ignores the manifest key and file. 1.11.0 adds the optional multi-lingual keys — top-level
  [`language`](#51-top-level-keys), the per-stem [`language`](#53-stems) hint, and the
  [`lyric_tracks`](#55-lyric_tracks) list (original / transliteration / translation lyric tracks) —
  all additive, an older Reader ignores them and still loads the single [`lyrics`](#71-lyricsjson)
  pointer as before. 1.12.0 adds the optional album-grouping / genre keys —
  [`album_artist`](#51-top-level-keys), [`track`](#51-top-level-keys), [`disc`](#51-top-level-keys),
  and [`genres`](#51-top-level-keys) — all additive, an older Reader ignores them.)
- If `feedpak_version` is **absent**, a Reader **MUST** treat the package as `"1.0.0"`. (This
  makes every package authored before the field existed a valid 1.0.0 package.)
- The value **MUST** be a valid semver string when present. A Reader **MUST** reject a value
  that is not parseable as semver, or **MAY** fall back to treating the package as `"1.0.0"`
  with a logged warning.

### 4.2. Compatibility policy

Changes to the format are released under semver semantics, applied to `feedpak_version`:

| Change | Bump | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** (`2.0.0`) | breaking | Required structure or semantics changed. Existing packages may need regeneration. |
| **MINOR** (`1.1.0`) | additive | New OPTIONAL manifest keys or side-files. Older Readers keep working by ignoring them. |
| **PATCH** (`1.0.1`) | editorial | Clarifications, fixed wording, metadata-only adjustments. No schema change. |

**Reader rules.** A Reader that supports feedpak major version *X*:

- **MUST** accept any package whose declared major version is *X*, regardless of its minor or
  patch (it ignores unknown minor additions per [§1.2](#12-roles)) — with the single exception that
  a package which *uses* an opt-in file-format relaxation the Reader does not implement (see the
  carve-out below) **MAY** be rejected with a clear error. This MUST-accept guarantee otherwise
  holds for all ordinary additive minor/patch changes.
- **SHOULD** warn, and **MAY** refuse with a clear error, when a package declares a major
  version **greater** than *X*.
- **MAY** accept a package whose major version is **less** than *X*, applying the
  backward-compatibility provisions this document defines.

**Writer rules.** A Writer **MUST NOT** introduce a backward-incompatible structural change
without bumping the **major** version. Additive changes (new optional keys/files) **MUST** be
released as a **minor** bump and **MUST** be safe for an older Reader to ignore.

**Carve-out: opt-in file-format relaxations.** One narrow class of change is released as a
**minor** bump even though an older Reader cannot transparently ignore it: an *opt-in relaxation
of how a file is encoded* — a data file's text, or a stem's audio codec — that a pack uses only
if it chooses to. Two such relaxations exist
in this document:

1. The [`.jsonc` extension](#8-reading-and-writing) (1.6.0), whose files may contain comments a
   Reader **MUST** strip.
2. [Audio stem formats beyond OGG](#532-audio-formats--baseline-dispatch-and-portability)
   (1.9.0): any stem not encoded as OGG (Vorbis). 1.9.0 both widens the MUST-decode baseline from
   OGG alone to **OGG + WAV** and allows further formats above it (FLAC, Opus, …). Because OGG was
   the only format guaranteed before 1.9.0, a Reader predating 1.9.0 may not decode even a baseline
   WAV stem, and no Reader is ever required to decode the above-baseline formats.

The justification for keeping each minor rather than major is that they are **strictly opt-in and
per-file**: a pack that does not adopt `.jsonc` — and a `.jsonc` file with no comments — is
byte-for-byte ordinary JSON every Reader handles; likewise a pack whose stems are all OGG is
decodable by every Reader regardless of version. Only a pack that *actually uses* a relaxation (a
comment-bearing `.jsonc` file, or a non-OGG stem with no OGG alternative) requires a Reader
supporting a later version — a 1.9.0 Reader for a WAV-only pack, or a Reader that opted into the
above-baseline format otherwise. A Writer wanting maximum cross-version compatibility therefore
**SHOULD** include an OGG stem. This is therefore an explicit, bounded exception both to the "older Readers keep working by
ignoring them" rule and to the **Reader rule** that a major-*X* Reader MUST accept any *X.y.z*
package (a Reader **MAY** reject a package that uses a relaxation it does not implement). It is
**not** a general license to add un-ignorable changes under a minor bump; any
future relaxation of this kind **MUST** be opt-in and per-file in the same way, or else be released
as a **major** bump. A Writer that needs maximum Reader compatibility **SHOULD NOT** rely on the
relaxation (for `.jsonc`: keep data files as comment-free `.json`).

### 4.3. Side-file schema versions

Several side-files carry their own integer `version` field at their top level
(`lyrics`/`vocal_pitch`/`song_timeline`/`drum_tab`/`notation_<id>` — see [§7](#7-side-files)).
These are **per-file schema versions** and are **orthogonal** to `feedpak_version`:

- They are plain integers (`1`, `2`, …), not semver, and start at `1`.
- They are bumped only when *that file's* entry shape changes incompatibly.
- A Reader **MUST NOT** assume any relationship between a side-file's `version` and the
  package's `feedpak_version`. Every new **object-shaped** side-file **SHOULD** include
  `"version": 1`. `lyrics.json` is the one exception — it is a flat array retained for
  backward compatibility and carries no `version` field (see [§7.1](#71-lyricsjson)).

### 4.4. Specification-document version

This published document has its own version (shown in the header, e.g. `1.0.0`) tracking the
prose, schemas, and examples. It matches the format `major.minor` it describes. Major revisions
of the format are published as new documents (`spec/feedpak-v2.md`); minor and patch revisions
update this document in place and are recorded in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md). Each
published version is frozen with a git tag (`v1.0.0`).

---

## 5. `manifest.yaml`

The manifest is the only REQUIRED file. It carries the song's metadata and indexes every other
file in the package.

Minimal valid manifest:

```yaml
feedpak_version: "1.0.0"
title: "Black Hole Sun"
artist: "Soundgarden"
duration: 320.5
arrangements:
  - id: lead
    name: Lead
    file: arrangements/lead.json
    tuning: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    capo: 0
stems:
  - id: full
    file: stems/full.ogg
    default: true
```

### 5.1. Top-level keys

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feedpak_version` | string (semver) | SHOULD | Format version the package conforms to (see [§4.1](#41-format-version--feedpak_version)). Absent ⇒ `"1.0.0"`. |
| `title` | string | **yes** | Song title. |
| `artist` | string | **yes** | Artist name. |
| `album` | string | no | Album. |
| `album_artist` | string | no | Album artist for the release. Used to group multi-artist / **compilation** albums under one album identity. Absent ⇒ falls back to `artist`. |
| `year` | int | no | Release year. |
| `track` | int | no | 1-based track number within the album, for album playback order. Absent ⇒ order is unspecified (a consumer MAY fall back to a filename/title heuristic or the user's own ordering). |
| `disc` | int | no | 1-based disc number for a multi-disc release. Absent ⇒ `1`. |
| `genres` | list | no | Zero or more genre labels (strings), most specific first; a consumer treats `genres[0]` as the primary genre. Free-form, but authors SHOULD prefer common, normalized names. Absent ⇒ unspecified. |
| `language` | string | no | [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47) tag for the song's **primary sung language** (e.g. `en`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh-Hans`). Absent ⇒ unspecified (treat as `und`). See [§5.5](#55-lyric_tracks). |
| `authors` | list | no | Human contributors who authored or edited this feedpak (see [§5.4](#54-authors)). Distinct from `artist`. |
| `duration` | number | **yes** | Song length in seconds. |
| `arrangements` | list | **yes** | Playable arrangements (see [§5.2](#52-arrangements)). MUST be non-empty. A notation-only entry still counts as an arrangement — it may omit `file` (see §5.2), but it is not an exception to the non-empty rule. |
| `stems` | list | **yes** | Audio stems (see [§5.3](#53-stems)). MUST be non-empty. |
| `stem_separation` | object | no | Provenance metadata when stems were produced by an automated separation engine. See [§5.3.1](#531-stem_separation). |
| `lyrics` | string (path) | no | Path to a lyrics JSON file (see [§7.1](#71-lyricsjson)). |
| `lyrics_source` | string | no | Origin of the lyrics: `authored`, `transcribed`, or `user`. Absent ⇒ treat as `authored`. See [§7.1](#71-lyricsjson). |
| `lyric_transcription` | object | no | Provenance metadata when lyrics came from an automated transcription engine. See [§7.1.1](#711-lyric_transcription). |
| `lyric_tracks` | list | no | Additional lyric representations — original-script, transliteration, and translation tracks, plus per-language sung originals. See [§5.5](#55-lyric_tracks). |
| `vocal_pitch` | string (path) | no | Path to per-syllable vocal pitch JSON (see [§7.2](#72-vocal_pitchjson)). |
| `pitch_extraction` | object | no | Provenance metadata when vocal pitch was extracted by an automated engine. See [§7.2.1](#721-pitch_extraction). |
| `vocal_pitch_contour` | string (path) | no | Path to a fine-grained pitch-contour JSON (see [§7.3](#73-vocal_pitch_contourjson)). |
| `cover` | string (path) | no | Path to cover image (JPEG/PNG). |
| `preview` | string (path) | no | Path to a short preview audio clip for hover-to-listen UIs. Same audio-format rules as stems ([§5.3.2](#532-audio-formats--baseline-dispatch-and-portability)) — OGG/WAV baseline, other formats allowed behind it. |
| `song_timeline` | string (path) | no | Path to a song-wide beats/sections file (see [§7.4](#74-song_timelinejson)). Takes priority over beats/sections embedded in arrangement JSON. |
| `drum_tab` | string (path) | no | Path to a drum-tab file (see [§7.5](#75-drum_tabjson)). |
| `keys` | string (path) | no | Path to a key/scale-annotation file (see [§7.7](#77-keysjson)). |
| `harmony` | string (path) | no | Path to a song-level harmony track (intended chord progression; see [§7.8](#78-harmonyjson)). |

Any key not listed here is an **extension key** and **MUST** be ignored by Readers that do not
understand it (see [§9](#9-extending-the-format)).

### 5.2. `arrangements[]`

Each entry describes one playable arrangement and points at its JSON file:

```yaml
arrangements:
  - id: lead                     # filesystem-safe stable id, used for filenames
    name: Lead                   # display name
    file: arrangements/lead.json
    tuning: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]   # six semitone offsets from E A D G B E
    capo: 0
    centOffset: 0.0              # OPTIONAL float, cents; default 0.0
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | — | **REQUIRED.** Stable, filesystem-safe, lowercase identifier; used in filenames and referenced by consumers. |
| `name` | string | `id` | Display name. |
| `file` | string (path) | — | Path to the arrangement JSON (see [§6](#6-arrangement-json)). MAY be omitted only when `notation` is present (see below). |
| `tuning` | int[] | `[0,0,0,0,0,0]` | Semitone offsets from standard `E2 A2 D2 G3 B3 E4`. Six elements is the standard 6-string-guitar convention; lengths **4–8** are accepted (4–6 = bass, 6–8 = extended-range guitar; length 6 is shared). Readers **MUST NOT** hard-code length 6. |
| `capo` | int | `0` | Capo fret. |
| `centOffset` | number | `0.0` | Pitch-shift in cents. Common values: `-1200.0` (one octave down for extended-range bass), small non-zero values for non-A440 reference pitch (e.g. A443 ≈ `+11.8`). |
| `type` | string | — | OPTIONAL instrument hint (`guitar`, `bass`, `piano`, `violin`, …). |
| `notation` | string (path) | — | OPTIONAL path to a standard-notation file for this arrangement (see [§7.6](#76-notation_idjson)). When present, `file` MAY be omitted and the arrangement is notation-only. |

Manifest-level `tuning`, `capo`, and `centOffset` **override** any equivalents embedded inside
the arrangement JSON; the in-JSON values are fallbacks.

### 5.3. `stems[]`

```yaml
stems:
  - id: full
    file: stems/full.ogg
    default: true        # plays by default when the song opens
  - id: drums
    file: stems/drums.ogg
    default: false
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | — | **REQUIRED.** Stable identifier referenced by consumers. |
| `file` | string (path) | — | **REQUIRED.** Path to the audio file. |
| `codec` | string | — | OPTIONAL codec hint (e.g. `"vorbis"`, `"opus"`, `"pcm"`, `"mp3"`, `"flac"`). When absent, the codec is inferred from the file extension; when present it **overrides** the extension (see [§5.3.2](#532-audio-formats--baseline-dispatch-and-portability)). Its main use is disambiguating an extension that doesn't pin the codec (container ≠ codec), but it MAY be set redundantly to be explicit. |
| `language` | string | — | OPTIONAL [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47) tag for a language-specific vocal stem (e.g. a `vocals_ja` stem with `language: ja` and a `vocals_en` stem with `language: en` for a song with two sung-language recordings). Absent ⇒ untagged — an instrumental stem or a stem whose language is unspecified. A [`lyric_tracks`](#55-lyric_tracks) entry's `stem` pointer pairs lyrics with the stem they were sung on. |
| `default` | boolean | `false` | Whether this stem is enabled when the song opens. |

`default` is logically boolean. For hand-edited convenience, Readers **MUST** also accept the
case-insensitive strings `"true"`/`"false"`, `"on"`/`"off"`, and `"yes"`/`"no"`, mapping them to
the obvious boolean. Writers **SHOULD** emit a real boolean or `"on"`/`"off"`.

`stems` **MUST** be non-empty. There is no required `id` or filename: a freshly converted pack
typically has a single `{id: full, file: stems/full.ogg}` entry; after stem splitting, `full`
is commonly replaced by per-instrument entries (`guitar`, `bass`, `drums`, `vocals`, `other`,
`piano`, …). No entry is guaranteed to be present beyond the non-empty requirement.

#### 5.3.1. `stem_separation`

When stems were produced by an automated source-separation engine, an OPTIONAL top-level
`stem_separation` object records the provenance:

```yaml
stem_separation:
  engine: demucs           # stable engine id
  model: htdemucs_6s       # engine-specific model name
  version: "1.0.0"         # semver for the stem-artifact contract
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `engine` | string | Stable identifier for the separation engine. |
| `model` | string | Engine-specific model id used for this split. |
| `version` | string (semver) | Version of the producer's stem-artifact contract, independent of the upstream engine version. Bump: patch = metadata-only, minor = backward-compatible additions, major = stem set / packaging / post-processing changed and existing splits should be regenerated. |

Omitted for single-stem packs and for hand-recorded or hand-edited stems. The three fields
together form a natural cache key: a consumer regenerating stems can treat any change among
them as a cache miss.

#### 5.3.2. Audio formats — baseline, dispatch, and portability

**Codec resolution (precedence).** A Reader determines a stem's codec in this order:

1. the explicit [`codec`](#53-stems) field, if present (it **overrides** the extension); else
2. the file extension (`.ogg` → Vorbis, `.opus` → Opus, `.wav` → PCM, `.mp3` → MP3, `.flac` → FLAC).

`codec` exists precisely for the cases where the extension is ambiguous or doesn't pin the codec
(a container that can hold more than one codec). A Reader decodes the formats it supports; for one
it does not, it **MUST** surface a clear error or fall back to another stem — it **MUST NOT** fail
silently into dead air.

**Decoder baseline.** A conformant Reader **MUST** decode:

- **OGG (Vorbis)** — `.ogg`
- **WAV (PCM)** — `.wav`

and **SHOULD** decode **MP3** (`.mp3`), **FLAC** (`.flac`), and **Opus** (`.opus`). These are
the recommended, broadly-portable formats; FLAC/WAV suit lossless masters, Opus/Vorbis/MP3 suit
compressed delivery.

**Portability rule.** A pack intended for distribution **MUST** include at least one stem whose
**resolved codec** (per the precedence above — `codec` override, else extension) is in the
MUST-decode baseline (in practice, an OGG or WAV `full` mix). The resolved codec, not the file
extension alone, is what counts: a stem declaring `file: stems/full.wav` with `codec: mp3` is an
MP3 stem and does **not** satisfy the baseline. Stems in any other
format are **opportunistic enhancements** layered on top of that guaranteed-playable baseline, so
a leaner Reader always has something to play. A Writer that controls its target environment **MAY**
omit the baseline stem, but such a pack is not portable and a Reader **MAY** reject it with a
clear error (see the [§4.2 opt-in carve-out](#42-compatibility-policy)).

**Other / proprietary formats (e.g. WEM).** The format is codec-agnostic enough that a Reader
**MAY** decode an extension outside the recommended set (for instance a desktop build that bundles
a decoder for Wwise `.wem`) — but such formats are **NOT** part of the baseline, **MUST NOT** be
the only stem in a distributable pack (the portability rule still applies), and this document
ships **no** reference decoder for them. Relying on a non-recommended format makes a pack
playable only on Readers that opted into it.

### 5.4. `authors[]`

An OPTIONAL top-level `authors` list credits the **people who authored or edited this feedpak** —
whoever transcribed the chart, arranged it, mixed the stems, or hand-corrected the data. This is
**distinct from `artist`**, which names the recording artist / musician who performed the song;
both MAY be present.

```yaml
authors:
  - name: Jane Smith            # display name or handle
    role: transcriber
    email: jane@example.com
    url: https://janesmith.dev
  - name: Bob Lee
    role: editor
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | — | **REQUIRED.** Contributor's name or handle. |
| `role` | string | — | OPTIONAL. What they contributed. The value is free-form and a Reader **MUST** accept any string; the RECOMMENDED vocabulary is `transcriber`, `arranger`, `charter`, `editor`, `mixer`, `engineer`, and `proofreader`. |
| `email` | string | — | OPTIONAL. Contact email. |
| `url` | string | — | OPTIONAL. Profile or homepage URL. |

When an entry omits `role`, a consumer **SHOULD** treat the contribution as unspecified rather
than infer one. The `authors` key is OPTIONAL: a pack with no contributor metadata simply omits
it, and a Reader that does not understand it ignores it per [§1.2](#12-roles).

### 5.5. `lyric_tracks[]`

An OPTIONAL top-level `lyric_tracks` list carries **multiple lyric representations** of a song so a
global audience can read along in the original script, a transliteration (romaji, pinyin, …), or a
translation — and so a song released with more than one sung-language recording can pair each
vocal with its own lyrics. Each entry points at a lyrics file that uses the **same flat-array shape
as [`lyrics.json`](#71-lyricsjson)** (the file schema is unchanged; only the manifest grows):

```yaml
language: ja                    # the song's primary sung language (§5.1)
lyrics: lyrics.json             # the legacy single pointer — kept for old Readers
lyric_tracks:
  - id: ja
    file: lyrics.json           # may reuse the same file the `lyrics` pointer names
    language: ja
    kind: original
    stem: vocals_ja
  - id: romaji
    file: lyrics_romaji.json
    language: ja-Latn
    kind: transliteration
  - id: en
    file: lyrics_en.json
    language: en
    kind: translation
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | — | **REQUIRED.** Stable, filesystem-safe, lowercase identifier for this track. |
| `file` | string (path) | — | **REQUIRED.** Path to a lyrics file in the [`lyrics.json`](#71-lyricsjson) flat-array shape. Two entries MAY name the same file (e.g. a `kind: original` track and the legacy `lyrics` pointer). |
| `language` | string | — | **REQUIRED.** [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47) tag for this track's text. Use a script subtag for a transliteration (e.g. `ja-Latn` romaji, `zh-Latn` pinyin). |
| `kind` | string | — | **REQUIRED.** One of `original` (the sung lyrics in their own language/script), `transliteration` (a phonetic re-spelling of an original, typically sharing its timing 1:1), or `translation` (the meaning in another language, for reading rather than precise sing-along). A Reader **MUST** accept these three and **SHOULD** treat any other value as `translation`. |
| `lyrics_source` | string | `authored` | OPTIONAL origin of this track: `authored`, `transcribed`, or `user` — same vocabulary as the manifest [`lyrics_source`](#71-lyricsjson). |
| `lyric_transcription` | object | — | OPTIONAL `{engine, model, version}` provenance when this track was machine-produced (transcribed or machine-translated) — same shape and semver semantics as [`stem_separation`](#531-stem_separation) and [`lyric_transcription`](#711-lyric_transcription). |
| `stem` | string | — | OPTIONAL id of the [`stems[]`](#53-stems) entry this track's lyrics were sung on — pairs a per-language sung `original` with its vocal recording. Omitted for transliteration/translation tracks, which ride the original performance. |
| `name` | string | `id` | OPTIONAL display label. |

**Relationship to the single `lyrics` pointer.** The [`lyrics`](#71-lyricsjson) /
[`lyrics_source`](#71-lyricsjson) / [`lyric_transcription`](#711-lyric_transcription) keys are
unchanged and remain valid on their own. When `lyric_tracks` is **absent**, a Reader behaves
exactly as before. When `lyric_tracks` is **present** it is authoritative for multi-track display,
and a Writer **SHOULD** also set `lyrics` to point at the `file` of the `kind: original` track whose
`language` matches the song's primary [`language`](#51-top-level-keys) — pointing at the same file,
not a copy — so a Reader predating 1.11.0 still shows lyrics. A Reader that understands
`lyric_tracks` **MAY** ignore the `lyrics` pointer when the list is present.

**No new file schema.** Each track is an ordinary [`lyrics.json`](#71-lyricsjson) array: a
transliteration track typically mirrors the original's syllable timing 1:1, while a translation
track carries its own (looser, reading-oriented) timing. The [§7.1](#71-lyricsjson) rule that
`lyrics.json` is a versionless flat array is preserved for every track. Per-track vocal pitch is
out of scope for this version (the melody is largely language-independent); a future version MAY
add it.

`lyric_tracks` is OPTIONAL; a Reader that does not understand it ignores it per [§1.2](#12-roles)
and falls back to the single `lyrics` pointer.

---

## 6. Arrangement JSON

Arrangement files (`arrangements/<id>.json`, or `arrangements/<id>.jsonc` for hand-edited
packs) carry the playable note/chord data for one arrangement — the **wire format**. This
document defines that format; it is the authoritative reference for it.

### 6.1. Top-level shape

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Lead",
  "tuning": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  "capo": 0,
  "centOffset": 0.0,           // OPTIONAL, float cents, default 0.0
  "notes":      [ /* §6.2 */ ],
  "chords":     [ /* §6.3 */ ],
  "anchors":    [ /* §6.4 */ ],
  "handshapes": [ /* §6.5 */ ],
  "templates":  [ /* §6.6 */ ],
  "phrases":    [ /* OPTIONAL, §6.7 */ ],
  "tones":      { /* OPTIONAL, §6.9 */ },
  "tempos":     [ /* OPTIONAL, §6.10 — per-chart tempo override */ ],
  "beats":      [ /* §6.8 — see note */ ],
  "sections":   [ /* §6.8 — see note */ ]
}
```

`beats` and `sections` are **song-level** data. For historical reasons they MAY appear inside
the first arrangement's JSON, in which case a Reader **MUST** hoist them to the song. New
packages **SHOULD** instead use a dedicated [`song_timeline.json`](#74-song_timelinejson). When
both are present, the `song_timeline.json` values **MUST** take priority.

### 6.2. Notes

Field names are short on purpose. A Writer **MUST NOT** expand them.

```jsonc
{
  "t": 12.345,    // time (s)
  "s": 2,         // string (0 = lowest)
  "f": 7,         // fret (0 = open, 24 = max)
  "sus": 0.5,     // sustain (s, 0 = none)
  "sl": 9,        // pitched slide-to fret (-1 = no slide)
  "slu": -1,      // unpitched slide-to fret (-1 = no slide)
  "bn": 1.0,      // bend amount in semitones (peak)
  "bt": 4,        // OPTIONAL bend intent (§6.2.1): 0 up, 1 release, 2 pre-bend, 3 pre-bend-release, 4 round-trip
  "bnv": [{ "t": 0, "v": 0 }, { "t": 0.25, "v": 1.0 }, { "t": 0.5, "v": 0 }],  // OPTIONAL time-stamped bend curve
  "ho": false,    // hammer-on
  "po": false,    // pull-off
  "hm": false,    // natural harmonic
  "hp": false,    // pinch harmonic
  "pm": false,    // palm mute
  "mt": false,    // string mute
  "vb": false,    // vibrato
  "tr": false,    // tremolo
  "ac": false,    // accent
  "tp": false,    // tap
  "ln": false,    // link-next (chord-linking metadata; renderers may ignore)
  "fhm": false,   // fret-hand mute
  "plk": false,   // pluck / pop (bass)
  "slp": false,   // slap (bass)
  "rh": -1,       // right-hand fingering (-1 = unset)
  "pkd": -1,      // pick direction (-1 = unset, 0 = down, 1 = up)
  "fg": -1,       // OPTIONAL fret-hand finger, teaching mark (§6.2.2): -1 unset, 0 thumb, 1–4 index→pinky
  "ch": -1,       // OPTIONAL strum-group key, teaching mark (§6.2.2): notes sharing a value ≥ 0 are one strum gesture
  "sd": -1,       // OPTIONAL scale degree, teaching mark (§6.2.2): chromatic offset 0–11 above the active key's tonic
  "ig": false     // ignore (authoring flag — rendered but not scored / sequenced)
}
```

Only `t`, `s`, and `f` are REQUIRED. Numeric defaults are `0`, or `-1` for the slide / `rh` /
`pkd` / `fg` / `ch` / `sd` fields; boolean defaults are `false`. When authoring by hand, a Writer
**MAY** omit any field equal to its default; a Reader **MUST** fill in defaults for absent fields.

#### 6.2.1. Bend shape (`bt`, `bnv`)

`bn` is the bend's **peak** magnitude in semitones. Two OPTIONAL fields describe its shape over
time; both were added in 1.4.0 and an older Reader simply ignores them, treating the note as a
plain bend-up to `bn`.

- **`bt`** — bend **intent**, an integer (default `0`):

  | `bt` | meaning |
  |---|---|
  | `0` | bend up (default) |
  | `1` | release (a held bend let down) |
  | `2` | pre-bend (already bent at the note's onset) |
  | `3` | pre-bend-and-release |
  | `4` | round-trip (bend up then back down within the note) |

- **`bnv`** — a **time-stamped bend curve**: an array of `{ "t": <seconds from the note's onset>,
  "v": <semitones> }` points, in non-descending `t` order. When present, `bnv` is the authoritative
  shape and `bt` is advisory; `bn` remains the peak for Readers that don't interpolate the curve.
  Omit `bnv` for a simple bend.

A note **SHOULD NOT** carry `bnv` or a non-zero `bt` when `bn` is `0`.

#### 6.2.2. Teaching marks (`fg`, `ch`, `sd`)

Three OPTIONAL fields added in 1.5.0 annotate *how a note is taught or displayed*. They are
**teaching marks**, not performance data: a renderer **MAY** show them, but a grader **MUST NOT**
use them to decide whether a note was played correctly. An older Reader ignores them.

- **`fg`** — the **fret-hand finger** the chart prescribes, an integer (default `-1`):

  | `fg` | finger |
  |---|---|
  | `-1` | unset — no prescription (default) |
  | `0` | thumb |
  | `1` | index |
  | `2` | middle |
  | `3` | ring |
  | `4` | pinky |

  This is the same convention as a chord [`template.fingers`](#63-chords) entry, lifted to the
  single note. `fg = -1` (or absent) means the chart does **not** prescribe a finger — it does
  **not** mean "wrong finger". A grader **MUST NOT** penalise a performance for the finger used.

- **`ch`** — a **strum-group key**, an integer (default `-1`). Notes within one arrangement that
  share the same `ch` value `≥ 0` are performed as a single strum or rake gesture and **MAY** be
  drawn with a strum indicator; [`pkd`](#62-notes) gives the gesture's direction. The value is an
  opaque grouping label, not an index or an ordering. `ch = -1` (or absent) means ungrouped.
  Whereas a chord groups notes sounded *simultaneously*, `ch` groups notes — possibly slightly
  staggered in `t` — that the player executes as one motion.

- **`sd`** — the note's **scale degree**, an integer `0`–`11` (default `-1`). It is the note's
  pitch class expressed as a **chromatic offset in semitones above the tonic** of the key/scale
  active at the note's time (see [`keys.json`](#77-keysjson)): `0` = tonic, `2` = major second,
  `3` = minor third, `7` = perfect fifth, and so on. A display layer maps it to a conventional
  degree label (`1`, `♭3`, `5`, …) using the active scale. Because `sd` is fully derivable from
  `keys.json` and the note's pitch, a Reader **MAY** compute it itself and a Writer **MAY** omit
  it; when present it is a cached value or an author override. `sd = -1` (or absent) means unset —
  for instance when no key is in effect.

### 6.3. Chords

A chord groups note-shaped objects under a single time:

```jsonc
{
  "t": 30.0,
  "id": 12,           // index into templates[]
  "hd": false,        // high-density flag
  "notes": [
    {"s": 0, "f": 3, "sus": 0.0},
    {"s": 1, "f": 5, "sus": 0.0}
  ],
  "fn": {"rn": "ii7", "q": "m7", "deg": 2}  // OPTIONAL harmonic function (§6.3.1)
}
```

Chord notes use the same field set as standalone notes **except** that `t` is omitted — the
chord carries the time. `id` indexes into `templates[]` for the fingering/shape.

#### 6.3.1. Harmonic function (`fn`)

`fn` is an OPTIONAL object describing the chord's harmonic function in the active key. Added in
1.7.0, it is a **teaching annotation**, not performance data: a renderer **MAY** display it, but a
grader **MUST NOT** use it to score whether the chord was played correctly. An older Reader ignores
it.

| key | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `rn` | string | Roman-numeral label, for display (e.g. `"ii7"`, `"V7"`, `"♭VII"`). |
| `q` | string | chord quality token (e.g. `"maj7"`, `"m7"`, `"7"`, `"m7b5"`, `"sus4"`). |
| `deg` | integer `0`–`11` | chromatic offset in semitones of the chord **root** above the tonic of the key/scale active at the chord's time (`0` = tonic), mirroring the per-note [`sd`](#622-teaching-marks-fg-ch-sd) convention. |

`fn` itself is OPTIONAL, but when present all three keys (`rn`, `q`, `deg`) are REQUIRED — a
half-specified function is ambiguous. `fn` describes the chord's **as-played** function and is fully derivable from the chord root and the
key active at its time (see [`keys.json`](#77-keysjson)), so a Reader **MAY** compute it and a
Writer **MAY** omit it; when present it is a cached value or an author override. It lives on the
chord **instance** (§6.3), not the [template](#66-chord-templates) — the same shape is reused across
keys, so its function is not a property of the shape. The song-level *harmony track*
([`harmony.json`](#78-harmonyjson)) instead carries the song's **intended** chord progression;
`fn` describes each chord as actually voiced, and the two are deliberately distinct (a Reader MAY
derive one from the other, but neither is authoritative).

The `q` token is drawn from a **shared chord-quality vocabulary** — a recommended (not closed) set
including `"maj"`, `"m"` (minor triad; `"min"` is an accepted synonym), `"maj7"`, `"m7"`, `"7"`,
`"m7b5"`, `"dim"`, `"aug"`, `"sus2"`, `"sus4"`, `"6"`, `"9"`, … — the same set
[`harmony.json`'s `quality`](#78-harmonyjson) uses, so the two stay interoperable.

### 6.4. Anchors

Where the fretting hand sits; drives a renderer's zoom/focus box.

```json
{"time": 12.0, "fret": 5, "width": 4}
```

### 6.5. Hand shapes

Spans during which a chord shape is held:

```json
{"chord_id": 12, "start_time": 30.0, "end_time": 31.5, "arp": false}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chord_id` | int | `0` | Index into `templates[]`. |
| `start_time` | number | `0.0` | Span start (s). |
| `end_time` | number | `0.0` | Span end (s). |
| `arp` | boolean | `false` | Treat as an arpeggio span rather than a strummed hold. |

### 6.6. Chord templates

Named shapes referenced by `chord.id` and `handshape.chord_id`:

```json
{
  "name": "Em7",
  "displayName": "Em7",
  "arp": false,
  "fingers": [-1, 2, 1, -1, -1, -1],
  "frets":   [ 0, 2, 2,  0,  0,  0],
  "voicing": "open",
  "caged": "E",
  "guideTones": [3, 10]
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | `""` | Canonical template name. |
| `displayName` | string | `name` | UI label (MAY carry display-only variants). |
| `arp` | boolean | `false` | Whether the template is arpeggiated. |
| `fingers` | int[] | all `-1` | Fretting-hand fingers, lowest string first. `-1` = unused, `0` = open / no finger, `1..4` = index/middle/ring/pinky. Length matches the string count. |
| `frets` | int[] | all `-1` | Fret numbers, lowest string first. `-1` = unused, `0` = open, positive = fretted. |
| `voicing` | string | `""` | OPTIONAL voicing type of the shape (1.7.0) — e.g. `"open"`, `"triad"`, `"shell"`, `"drop2"`, `"drop3"`, `"barre"`. A **teaching annotation** (display only — a grader **MUST NOT** score it); free-form, but a Writer SHOULD prefer the listed tokens. It describes the key-independent shape, which is why it lives on the template rather than the chord instance (cf. [`fn`](#631-harmonic-function-fn)). |
| `caged` | string | `""` | OPTIONAL CAGED-system shape (1.8.0) the fingering derives from — one of `"C"`, `"A"`, `"G"`, `"E"`, `"D"`. A **teaching annotation** (display only — a grader **MUST NOT** score it). Like `voicing`, it describes the key-independent shape, so it rides the template. |
| `guideTones` | int[] | `[]` | OPTIONAL guide tones (1.8.0) — chromatic semitone offsets `0`–`11` above the chord **root** marking the tones that most define the chord's quality (typically the 3rd and 7th); e.g. a dominant-7 → `[4, 10]` (major 3rd, minor 7th). A **teaching annotation** (display only — a grader **MUST NOT** score it). Root-relative, hence key-independent, so it rides the template. |

### 6.7. Phrases (OPTIONAL — multi-difficulty data)

Sources that carry a per-phrase difficulty ladder include this:

```jsonc
"phrases": [
  {
    "start_time": 0.0,
    "end_time":   12.5,
    "max_difficulty": 4,
    "levels": [
      { "difficulty": 0, "notes": [], "chords": [], "anchors": [], "handshapes": [] },
      { "difficulty": 1, "notes": [], "chords": [], "anchors": [], "handshapes": [] }
    ]
  }
]
```

A Writer with no multi-difficulty data **MUST omit the `phrases` key entirely** rather than
emit `"phrases": []`. A missing key means "single fixed difficulty"; the distinction is
normative because consumers gate a difficulty control on the key's presence.

### 6.8. Beats and sections

```json
"beats":    [{"time": 0.5, "measure": 1}, {"time": 1.0, "measure": -1}],
"sections": [{"name": "verse", "number": 1, "time": 12.5}]
```

`measure: -1` marks a sub-beat (not a downbeat). Section `name` follows the usual
song-structure vocabulary (`intro`, `verse`, `chorus`, `bridge`, `solo`, `outro`, …). See the
note in [§6.1](#61-top-level-shape) regarding placement and the `song_timeline.json` priority
rule.

### 6.9. Tones (OPTIONAL)

`tones` carries the arrangement's gear (amp/pedal/cabinet) and in-song tone switches. Omitted
when the source carries no tone data.

```jsonc
"tones": {
  "base": "Clean Rhythm",
  "changes": [
    {"t": 12.5, "name": "Lead Drive"},
    {"t": 48.0, "name": "Clean Rhythm"}
  ],
  "definitions": [
    {"name": "Clean Rhythm", "id": "tone-1", "gear": { /* opaque, source-specific gear data */ }}
  ]
}
```

- `base` (string) — tone in effect before the first change.
- `changes` (list, time-sorted) — `{"t": seconds, "name": str}` switches.
- `definitions` (list) — raw, opaque tone objects copied from the source. Readers that do not
  interpret gear **MUST** preserve `tones` verbatim.

All three sub-keys are individually OPTIONAL.

### 6.10. Per-arrangement tempo (OPTIONAL)

A chart MAY declare its own tempo map, overriding the song-wide tempo for that arrangement only.
This supports an arrangement authored at a different tempo from the rest of the song (a half-time
feel, a slowed practice chart, …). The shape is identical to the song-level
[`tempos`](#74-song_timelinejson):

```json
"tempos": [
  {"time": 0.0, "bpm": 80.0},
  {"time": 30.0, "bpm": 160.0}
]
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `time` | number | Event time (s). REQUIRED. |
| `bpm` | number | Beats per minute, `> 0`. REQUIRED. Applies until the next event. |

**Priority.** When the consumer plays this arrangement and the arrangement carries a non-empty
`tempos`, a Reader **MUST** use it and **MUST** ignore the song-level
[`song_timeline.json` `tempos`](#74-song_timelinejson) for this chart. When the arrangement omits
`tempos`, the song-level tempo applies. A Writer **MUST omit the key entirely** when the chart
follows the song tempo rather than emit `"tempos": []`. `time_signatures` are **song-level only**
and are not overridden per arrangement.

---

## 7. Side-files

Each side-file is referenced from the manifest by a pointer key (the "manifest opt-in, file off
to the side" pattern; see [§9.1](#91-the-golden-rule-manifest-opt-in-file-off-to-the-side)).
Side-files use the `.json` extension by convention; hand-edited side-files MAY use `.jsonc` to
signal that the file contains comments. Every side-file that is a JSON **object SHOULD** carry a
top-level integer `version` (see [§4.3](#43-side-file-schema-versions)). The one exception is
`lyrics.json`, which is a flat JSON array kept for backward compatibility: it carries no
`version` field, and its origin and revision are tracked at the manifest level instead
(`lyrics_source`, `lyric_transcription`).

### 7.1. `lyrics.json`

Referenced by the manifest `lyrics` key. A flat JSON list of syllable objects. Unlike the
object-shaped side-files, `lyrics.json` carries **no** top-level `version` field — it is an
array kept in this shape for backward compatibility, and its origin/revision is tracked at the
manifest level (`lyrics_source`, `lyric_transcription`). This is the one documented exception to
the side-file `version` guidance in [§4.3](#43-side-file-schema-versions) and [§9.3](#93-always-include-version).

```json
[
  {"t": 12.34, "d": 0.18, "w": "Hel"},
  {"t": 12.52, "d": 0.22, "w": "lo-"},
  {"t": 13.10, "d": 0.30, "w": "world"}
]
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `t` | number | Time (s). |
| `d` | number | Duration (s). |
| `w` | string | Syllable text. A trailing `-` joins to the next syllable as one word; a trailing `+` marks the last syllable of a line. Both are suffixes on a real syllable, not standalone entries. |

The manifest `lyrics_source` key records the origin: `authored` (from an authored chart),
`transcribed` (machine-generated by an automated engine — speech transcription, and, for
[`lyric_tracks`](#55-lyric_tracks), machine translation or transliteration), or `user`
(hand-edited). Absent ⇒ `authored`. A UI MAY use this to badge machine-generated lyrics
differently.

A song MAY carry **more than one lyric track** — an original-script track plus a transliteration
and/or translation, or per-language sung originals. These additional tracks are listed in the
manifest [`lyric_tracks`](#55-lyric_tracks) key (§5.5); each one is a file in this same flat-array
shape. The single `lyrics` pointer remains the backward-compatible primary track.

#### 7.1.1. `lyric_transcription`

When `lyrics_source` is `transcribed` (or any future automated origin), an OPTIONAL top-level
`lyric_transcription` object records `{engine, model, version}` with the same shape and semver
semantics as [`stem_separation`](#531-stem_separation), identifying the automated engine that
produced the text — speech transcription, or (for a [`lyric_tracks`](#55-lyric_tracks) entry)
machine translation or transliteration. Omitted for `authored`/`user` lyrics.

### 7.2. `vocal_pitch.json`

Referenced by the manifest `vocal_pitch` key — the per-syllable karaoke companion to lyrics:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "notes": [
    {"t": 12.34, "d": 0.40, "midi": 64},
    {"t": 12.78, "d": 0.55, "midi": 67}
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | int | Schema version of this file (currently `1`). |
| `notes` | list | One entry per syllable that could be pitched. `t`/`d` mirror the matching `lyrics.json` entry; `midi` is the MIDI note number (60 = middle C). Unpitched syllables are omitted, so this list MAY be shorter than `lyrics.json`. |

#### 7.2.1. `pitch_extraction`

When pitch came from an automated engine, an OPTIONAL top-level `pitch_extraction` object
records `{engine, model, version}` — same shape and semver-string semantics as
[`stem_separation`](#531-stem_separation). This is distinct from the in-file integer `version`
above. Omitted for hand-edited pitch tracks.

### 7.3. `vocal_pitch_contour.json`

Referenced by the manifest `vocal_pitch_contour` key — a fine-grained pitch contour (one sample
every ~20 ms, Hz rather than MIDI). It is a *different shape* from `vocal_pitch.json` and rides
its own manifest key so the two never collide:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "samples": [
    {"t": 0.000, "hz": 220.5},
    {"t": 0.020, "hz": 222.1}
  ]
}
```

### 7.4. `song_timeline.json`

Referenced by the manifest `song_timeline` key. Holds the song-wide rhythmic grid — beats,
sections, and (since 1.2.0) the song's tempo and time-signature maps — in one dedicated,
instrument-independent file, out of the first arrangement JSON:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "tempos": [
    {"time": 0.000, "bpm": 120.0},
    {"time": 64.000, "bpm": 90.0}
  ],
  "time_signatures": [
    {"time": 0.000, "ts": [4, 4]},
    {"time": 32.000, "ts": [6, 8]}
  ],
  "beats": [
    {"time": 0.500, "measure": 1},
    {"time": 1.000, "measure": -1},
    {"time": 2.000, "measure": 2}
  ],
  "sections": [
    {"name": "intro",  "number": 1, "time": 0.0},
    {"name": "verse",  "number": 1, "time": 16.0},
    {"name": "chorus", "number": 1, "time": 32.0}
  ]
}
```

`tempos` and `time_signatures` are each OPTIONAL, time-ordered, and follow the same
"each entry applies until the next" rule as [`keys.json`](#77-keysjson). Adding them did not
change the file's `version`, which stays `1`.

| `tempos[]` field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `time` | number | Event time (s). REQUIRED. |
| `bpm` | number | Beats per minute, `> 0`. REQUIRED. In effect until the next `tempos` entry. |

| `time_signatures[]` field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `time` | number | Event time (s). REQUIRED. |
| `ts` | int[2] | `[numerator, denominator]`, each `≥ 1` (same convention as notation `ts`, [§7.6](#76-notation_idjson)). REQUIRED. In effect until the next entry. |

| `beats[]` field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `time` | number | Beat timestamp (s). |
| `measure` | int | 1-based downbeat number; `-1` = sub-beat. |

| `sections[]` field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Song-structure name (`intro`, `verse`, `chorus`, …). |
| `number` | int | Repeat number. |
| `time` | number | Section start (s). |

The song-level `tempos` map is the song-wide **playback/timing** tempo, distinct from the
per-measure `tempo` inside [`notation_<id>.json`](#76-notation_idjson) (§7.6), which exists for
staff rendering. An arrangement MAY override `tempos` for its own chart — see
[§6.10](#610-per-arrangement-tempo-optional).

When `song_timeline.json` is present and valid, its data **MUST** take priority over any
beats/sections embedded in arrangement JSON. When absent, the Reader **MUST** fall back to the
arrangement-embedded data per [§6.1](#61-top-level-shape). No migration is required for older
packages.

### 7.5. `drum_tab.json`

Referenced by the manifest `drum_tab` key — per-piece drum hits:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "Drums",
  "kit": [
    {"id": "kick",      "name": "Kick"},
    {"id": "snare",     "name": "Snare"},
    {"id": "hh_closed", "name": "Hi-hat (closed)"},
    {"id": "ride",      "name": "Ride"}
  ],
  "hits": [
    {"t": 0.500, "p": "kick",      "v": 110},
    {"t": 0.750, "p": "snare",     "v":  92},
    {"t": 0.750, "p": "hh_closed", "v":  70},
    {"t": 1.000, "p": "snare",     "v":  60, "g": true},
    {"t": 1.250, "p": "snare",     "v": 105, "f": true},
    {"t": 4.000, "p": "crash_r",   "v": 120, "k": 0.080}
  ]
}
```

| `hits[]` field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `t` | number | Hit time (s), REQUIRED, monotonic across `hits[]`. |
| `p` | string | Piece-id from the vocabulary below, REQUIRED. |
| `v` | int 1–127 | Velocity (default `100`). |
| `g` | boolean | Ghost note. |
| `f` | boolean | Flam. |
| `k` | number | Cymbal-choke tail duration (s). |

`kit[]` is the legend (stable metadata); `hits[]` is the hot path (short field names). Open and
closed hi-hat are **distinct piece-ids**, not articulation flags — a scorer can only reject a
wrong-articulation strike if the articulation is part of the id.

**Canonical piece-id vocabulary.** This is a closed list for v1; unknown piece-ids **MUST**
round-trip (a Reader renders them with a sensible default rather than erroring).

| Piece-id | Category | Default GM MIDI |
|---|---|---|
| `kick` | kick | 35, 36 |
| `snare` | drum | 38, 40 |
| `snare_xstick` | drum | 37 |
| `tom_hi` | drum | 50, 48 |
| `tom_mid` | drum | 47, 45 |
| `tom_low` | drum | 43 |
| `tom_floor` | drum | 41 |
| `hh_closed` | cymbal | 42 |
| `hh_open` | cymbal | 46 |
| `hh_pedal` | cymbal | 44 |
| `stack` | cymbal | 30 |
| `crash_l` | cymbal | 49 |
| `crash_r` | cymbal | 57 |
| `splash` | cymbal | 55 |
| `china` | cymbal | 52 |
| `ride` | cymbal | 51, 59 |
| `ride_bell` | cymbal | 53 |
| `bell` | cymbal | 80 |

### 7.6. `notation_<id>.json`

Referenced by an **arrangement entry's** `notation` key (per-arrangement, not song-wide — a
song MAY carry both `notation_keys.json` and `notation_violin.json`). Promotes staff-notation
instruments (keys, piano, strings, …) to first-class data, separate from the guitar wire
format.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "instrument": "piano",
  "staves": [
    {"id": "rh", "clef": "G2", "label": "Right Hand"},
    {"id": "lh", "clef": "F4", "label": "Left Hand"}
  ],
  "measures": [
    {
      "idx": 1,
      "t": 0.0,
      "ts": [4, 4],
      "ks": 0,
      "tempo": 120.0,
      "staves": {
        "rh": {"voices": [{"v": 1, "beats": [
          {"t": 0.000, "dur": 4, "notes": [{"midi": 64}]},
          {"t": 0.500, "dur": 4, "notes": [{"midi": 67}]}
        ]}]},
        "lh": {"voices": [{"v": 1, "beats": [
          {"t": 0.000, "dur": 1, "notes": [{"midi": 52}, {"midi": 60}]}
        ]}]}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Top-level fields**

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | int | Always `1` for this schema. |
| `instrument` | string | `piano`, `violin`, `guitar`, … Mirrors the arrangement `type`; makes the file self-describing. |
| `rights` / `lyricist` / `arranger` | string | OPTIONAL credits. Omit when absent. |
| `staves` | list | Static staff definitions: `id` (stable, referenced by `measures[].staves` keys), `clef`, OPTIONAL `label`. |
| `measures` | list | Ordered measure data — the hot path. |

**Clef vocabulary:** `G2` (treble), `F4` (bass), `C3` (alto), `C4` (tenor), `neutral`
(unpitched/percussion).

**Measure fields:** `idx` (1-based number), `t` (downbeat time, s), `ts` (`[num, den]`, omit if
unchanged), `beat_groups` (int[] for compound/irregular meters; the sum MUST equal the
numerator; omit for simple meters), `ks` (key signature, −7..+7 semitones from C; negative =
flats; omit if unchanged), `tempo` (BPM, omit if unchanged), `pickup` (bool anacrusis flag, omit
when false), `staves` (keyed by staff `id`; each has OPTIONAL `clef` and `voices`).

**Beat fields** (inside `staves → voices → beats`): `t` (required), `dur` (required denominator:
`1`=whole … `32`=thirty-second), `dot`, `rest`, `tu` (`[num, den]` tuplet), `beat_pos`
(`[num, den]` exact position within the measure), `notes`, `dyn`, `slr`/`slre`, `grace`
(`"a"`/`"p"`), `arp`, `ferm`, sustain-pedal `spd`/`sph`/`spu`, and additional optional effects
(`cre`, `dec`, `vib`, `vibw`, `fade`, `pm`, `lr`, `slap`, `pop`, `tap`, `su`, `sd`, `rasg`,
`golpe`, `wah`, `txt`, `chrd`).

**Note fields** (inside `beats → notes`): `midi` (required, 0–127), `tied`, `acc` (accidental
override: `0`=force natural, `−2..2` = double-flat..double-sharp), `stem` (`"up"`/`"down"`), and
additional optional effects (`stc`, `ten`, `ac`, `hac`, `vib`, `vibw`, `dead`, `ghost`, `fng`,
`rfng`, `str`, `harm`, `bend`, `slide`, `trill`, `ho`, `po`, `tp`, `barre`).

**v1 non-features (out of scope; ship later only as additive v1.x optional fields):** microtonal
pitch finer than `acc`; figured bass; mid-measure key/time/clef changes (all three are
measure-granular in v1); ottava lines, repeat/volta barline semantics, ornaments beyond trills,
notated tremolo, and glissando lines. A Writer **MUST** drop a source feature on this list (with
a logged warning) rather than approximate it into wrong notation; a Reader **MUST NOT** invent
semantics for an unspecified field name before a future version defines it.

### 7.7. `keys.json`

Referenced by the manifest `keys` key — key/scale annotations for theory-aware visualisations.
Each entry applies until the next:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "events": [
    {"t":   0.0, "key": "Em", "scale": "natural_minor"},
    {"t":  64.5, "key": "G",  "scale": "major"}
  ]
}
```

> **Note — `keys.json` is not a keyboard part.** Despite the name, this file is a song-level
> musical-key/scale track and is **instrument-independent**: it has nothing to do with a keyboard
> or piano arrangement (an arrangement `type: keys`, or a `notation_<id>.json`). A guitar-only,
> drums-only, or stems-only pack uses `keys.json` to tell the player "the song is in Em, then
> changes to G major at 64.5 s" with no keyboard part anywhere in the package. The `keys` manifest
> pointer (this file) and the `keys` instrument hint are unrelated.

---

### 7.8. `harmony.json`

Referenced by the manifest `harmony` key — the song's **intended chord progression**: the chords
the song *is*, independent of what any one arrangement plays. This is the reference/teaching
track a fretboard-theory overlay, a "chords" lyric line, or a practice-along reads; a simplified
or solo arrangement won't carry it per-chord, so it lives once at the song level. Time-ordered
events, each applying until the next (the same shape as [`keys.json`](#77-keysjson)):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "events": [
    {"t": 0.0, "root": "G",  "quality": "maj7", "rn": "I"},
    {"t": 2.0, "root": "E",  "quality": "m7",   "rn": "vi", "bass": "G"},
    {"t": 4.0, "root": "C",  "quality": "maj7", "rn": "IV"},
    {"t": 6.0, "root": null}
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Req | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `t` | number | **yes** | Event time (s); applies until the next event (matches `keys.json`'s `t`). |
| `root` | string \| null | — | Chord root note name — `"G"`, `"F#"`, `"Bb"` (same note-name convention as `keys.json`'s `key`). **`null` marks a no-chord (N.C.) event** — a rest/breakdown with no harmony until the next event; without it the apply-until-next rule would wrongly sustain the previous chord. Omitting `root` entirely is equivalent to `null`. |
| `quality` | string | — | Quality token (e.g. `"maj7"`, `"m7"`, `"7"`, `"dim"`, `"sus4"`). Drawn from the **shared chord-quality vocabulary** (see [§6.3.1](#631-harmonic-function-fn)); the set is recommended, not closed. |
| `rn` | string | — | Roman numeral relative to the active [`keys.json`](#77-keysjson) key, for display (like `fn.rn`). **Meaningful only when a key is active at this `t`** — omit it when `keys.json` is absent or has no event covering this time. |
| `bass` | string | — | Slash-chord bass note when different from `root` (e.g. `G/B` → `root: "G"`, `bass: "B"`). |

**Spelling.** `root` and `bass` **SHOULD** follow the active key's spelling convention (e.g. `Bb`
in F major, `A#` in B major) so a derived `rn`/notation reads correctly; the absolute spelling is
authoritative and the relative view is derived from it.

**Relationship to `fn`.** `harmony.json` is the song's *intended* progression (one per song,
reference data); per-chord [`fn`](#631-harmonic-function-fn) is the *as-played* function on a
specific arrangement's chords. They may agree or deliberately diverge (a simplified arrangement
plays a subset). A Reader **MAY** derive `fn` from `harmony.json` + the played chord, but neither
is authoritative over the other.

**No voicing.** `harmony.json` is abstract harmony only — it carries no fingering and does **not**
index the arrangement [chord templates](#66-chord-templates); voicings are an arrangement concern.

**Honesty rule.** The harmony track is reference/teaching data: a renderer/teacher **MAY** display
it; a grader **MUST NOT** use it to score the player's notes. (A backing engine that *plays* the
progression is a separate, dependent proposal, not part of this track.)

> **Note — repeats are flattened.** Events are a flat, time-ordered list, so a progression that
> recurs (e.g. a chorus) is repeated in full at each occurrence — the same tradeoff `keys.json`
> and `song_timeline.json` make. A section-relative encoding is out of scope for this version.

## 8. Reading and writing

This section is **informative** — it describes the typical lifecycle, not additional
requirements.

**Reading.** Parse `manifest.yaml`; read `title`/`artist`/`duration`/`feedpak_version` for a
quick metadata view. For a full load, resolve each manifest pointer to its file, validate it
against the relevant schema, and merge per the priority rules in [§6.1](#61-top-level-shape) and
[§7.4](#74-song_timelinejson). Unknown manifest keys and files are retained, not discarded.

**JSONC comments (normative).** The requirements in this paragraph are binding, notwithstanding
the otherwise-informative framing of §8. When a manifest pointer resolves to a `.jsonc` file, a
Reader **MUST** strip C-style comments (`//` line comments and `/* */` block comments) before
parsing the JSON content.
Comments are the **only** relaxation permitted: trailing commas, single-quoted strings, and other
JSON5-style extensions are **NOT** allowed — after comment removal the content **MUST** be strict,
valid JSON. A Writer that preserves edits to a `.jsonc` file **SHOULD** leave the original comments
intact. For new hand-edited packs, Writers **MAY** write `.jsonc` data files and **MAY** include
comments in them.

Note on compatibility. `.jsonc` is governed by the **opt-in file-format relaxation carve-out** in
[§4.2](#42-compatibility-policy), not by the ordinary "older Readers keep working by ignoring them"
rule. Two facts must be kept separate:

1. **No existing pack breaks.** Packs that do not adopt `.jsonc` are entirely unchanged, and a
   comment-free `.jsonc` file is byte-for-byte valid JSON.
2. **A `.jsonc` file that actually contains comments is NOT readable by a strict-JSON-only
   Reader** — such a Reader errors on `//` and `/* */`. Only a Reader that implements the
   comment-stripping step above can read it. Unlike the optional fields added under a normal minor
   bump, comments cannot be safely *ignored* by an unaware Reader — which is exactly why §4.2 lists
   this as a bounded, opt-in exception.

A Writer that needs a pack to be readable by the broadest range of Readers therefore **SHOULD**
keep its data files as comment-free `.json`.

**Writing.** Build the package in a working directory: write `arrangements/<id>.json` per
arrangement; encode audio into `stems/`; write any side-files; compose `manifest.yaml` last so
its index matches what was written. Emit YAML with block style and **preserve key order** for
human readability (do not sort keys). Then either keep the directory form or zip it into a
`.feedpak` archive. A round-trip (write → read → write) **SHOULD** be lossless for all
recognised fields and **MUST** preserve unrecognised ones.

---

## 9. Extending the format

feedpak is designed to be extended without breaking older Readers. The conventions below are
how `lyrics`, `stems`, `drum_tab`, `song_timeline`, and `notation` were each added.

### 9.1. The golden rule: manifest opt-in, file off to the side

1. **Drop a new file** alongside the standard ones (`drums.json`, `keys.json`, …).
2. **Add a manifest key** that *points at* that file (`drum_tab: drum_tab.json`).
3. **Gate consumers on the manifest key.** If the key is absent, do nothing. Never
   auto-discover by filename — that breaks the "manifest is the index" rule ([§2.2](#22-three-core-rules)).

Older Readers ignore the unknown key; new consumers act on it. No coordination with other
implementations is required.

### 9.2. Naming conventions

- **Manifest keys:** `snake_case`, descriptive; singular for one value (`lyrics`, `cover`,
  `drum_tab`), plural for lists (`stems`, `arrangements`).
- **Filenames:** lowercase; JSON (`.json`) or JSONC (`.jsonc`) for structured data, audio in a baseline-or-recommended format (`.ogg`/`.wav`, or `.mp3`/`.flac`/`.opus` — see [§5.3.2](#532-audio-formats--baseline-dispatch-and-portability)), JPEG/PNG for images.
- **JSON fields:** short names for hot-path data streamed many times (`t`, `s`, `f`); long names
  for one-off metadata.
- **Time fields:** always `t` or `time`, always seconds as floats.
- **Ids/indexes:** stable, filesystem-safe, lowercase.

### 9.3. Always include `version`

Every new **object-shaped** side-file **SHOULD** carry `"version": 1`. It is free insurance: a
later incompatible change becomes `version: 2`, and old consumers can branch or fall back
gracefully. (The legacy `lyrics.json` array is the lone exception — see
[§7.1](#71-lyricsjson).)

### 9.4. Stay backward-compatible

- **Adding fields** is always safe (older Readers ignore them) — release as a **minor** format bump.
- **Removing fields** breaks older Readers — do not; release only under a **major** bump.
- **Repurposing fields** (changing meaning or units) is the most dangerous — bump the side-file
  `version` (and the format major if it is structural) and branch. Prefer adding a new field and
  sunsetting the old one over a version or two.

### 9.5. What does NOT belong in a feedpak

A feedpak holds the song's **authored data** only. The following **MUST NOT** be written into a
package, because they vary by user or machine:

- Per-machine settings (device picks, network addresses, hardware universes).
- UI state (zoom level, panel sizes).
- User progress, scores, or play counts.

---

## 10. Conformance checklist

A **conformant feedpak** (normative summary):

- [ ] Has a `manifest.yaml` at the root, UTF-8, parseable as YAML.
- [ ] Manifest has `title`, `artist`, `duration`, a non-empty `arrangements`, and a non-empty
      `stems`. (A notation-only arrangement counts toward `arrangements`; it may omit `file` —
      see [§5.2](#52-arrangements) — but does not relax the non-empty rule.)
- [ ] Every manifest pointer resolves to an existing file via a safe POSIX relative path.
- [ ] `feedpak_version`, if present, is a valid semver string.
- [ ] Every side-file validates against its schema and carries a `version` where this document
      requires one.
- [ ] Times are seconds; hot-path field names are unexpanded.

A **conformant Reader**:

- [ ] Accepts both directory and zip forms.
- [ ] Resolves all data through the manifest, never by filename scanning.
- [ ] Ignores (and, when re-emitting, preserves) unknown keys/files/fields.
- [ ] Applies the `feedpak_version` reader rules ([§4.2](#42-compatibility-policy)) and the
      `song_timeline` priority rule ([§7.4](#74-song_timelinejson)).
- [ ] Rejects paths that escape the package root.

---

## Appendix A (non-normative) — streaming and runtime notes

An application **MAY** transport feedpak data to a renderer over a streaming protocol (e.g. a
WebSocket) rather than handing over the on-disk files directly. Such protocols typically reuse
the same per-object field names defined here, often chunked into typed messages (song info,
notes, chords, beats, sections, lyrics, drum hits, notation measures, …). This is an
implementation choice and is **not** part of the format: the on-disk package defined by §2–§7 is
the sole normative artifact, and the byte-for-byte layout of any wire protocol is out of scope.

## Appendix B (non-normative) — media conventions

- **Stems:** OGG (Vorbis), ~`-q:a 5`, is the recommended default and baseline; other formats are
  allowed behind the decoder baseline + portability rule ([§5.3.2](#532-audio-formats--baseline-dispatch-and-portability)). Mono or stereo as the source dictates.
- **Preview clip:** a short clip (a few seconds) for hover-to-listen UIs; same format guidance as stems.
- **Cover art:** JPEG or PNG, square, 500–1500 px on a side.
